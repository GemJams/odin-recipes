        <h3>What this?</h3>
        Easy baked feta pasta recipe. I made this pasta to use up the feta I had in the fridge. Originally made on 22/5/2023.
        <p>This recipe is originally from <a href ="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/baked-feta-pasta-9867689">here </a>.</p>

            <li>500g cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>225g block feta</li>
            <li>280g pasta</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup basil, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>

            <li>Put in oven for 30 minutes. Raise the heat to 225oC and continue to cook until tomatoes and feta are golden brown, 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta, set aside 1/2 cup of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>As soon as the feta and tomatoes are out of the oven, add the garlic and mix all together, crushing the tomatoes. Stir in the pasta and basil. EAT!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>My Review</h3>
        Yum. I'd make again. Great winter comfort food. Makes 2 and a halfish serves though. Also annoying that is uses less than a full packet of the protein pasta.
