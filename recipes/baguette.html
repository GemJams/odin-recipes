        <h3>My Review</h3>
        Really simple and easy to make. The baguette itself is a little bland, but perfect to use as a vehicle for dips.
        Next time I should shape the baguettes longer, at the moment they are a little chodey!
        I think I put it in for the full 25 minutes, and they browned more than I would've liked. <strong> NOTE</strong> bake for 20 minutes next time and check from there.
